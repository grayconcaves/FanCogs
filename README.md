# FanCogs
Cogs made by **grayconcaves** for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop)

To add this repo to your bot: `[p]repo add FanCogs https://github.com/grayconcaves/FanCogs/` 

This repository contains a few fandom cogs I've made for my Red V3 bot, **Super Dage**. I hope this will be of help for you too!

I'm personally a noob coder so if there are any improvements that you can suggest, feel free to tell me!
